# Pong Game

## My re-creation of a personal favourite and classic game, Pong.

While learning the basics of Unity, I decided to put my skills to the test and create Pong. This project uses Unity 2D, C# Scripts and TextMeshPro.

### Features:
- Colour-changing scores depending on which player is winning
- 2-player gameplay with W/S and Up/Down keys
- 7 point maximum, afterwhich gameplay ends with option to restart
